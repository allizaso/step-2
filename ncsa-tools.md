# NCSA Tools and Technologies

* [Puppet](https://www.puppet.com/): current configuration management tool, firewall.pp makes firewall rules for kerberos. Puppet runs and checks to see if the master server matches what puppet thinks it should have then it will fix it
* [bro/zeek](https://docs.zeek.org/en/master/about.html#what-is-zeek): Zeek is  a passive, open-source network traffic analyzer. Written at NCSA, looks for unusual activity on the network and sends alerts. Used for network monitoring, network tapping. bro analyzes network traffic, makes determinations if things should get blocked or send alerts. Was used to manually block, (black hole routing BHR, direct/manual blocks), but now the NCSA security team usually let splunk decide if something should get autoblocked or alerted on
* [bastion](https://www.lunavi.com/blog/whats-a-jumpbox-or-bastion-host-anyway): ssh jump host, securities are bastion1, bastion2, bastion3, bastion4. Generic NCSA bastion is called cerberus. These are the initial access points to get to security infrastructure, from there the security staff can jump to splunk and the security github
* [ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/): configuration management tool, security doesn't normally use it, looking to move to it because new version puppet versions will cost money. Works opposite of puppet, ansible runs playbook against the host. Puppet doesn't work as well for networking, ansible is better for networked equipment
* [Advanced Computational Health Enclave (ACHE)](https://ng-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): the regulated computing environment for ePHI (electronic Personal Health Information)
* [mForge](https://mayoillinois.org/): the regulated computing environment for the Mayo Clinic at NCSA
* [Nightingale Cluster](https://ng-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): the high performance computing cluster environment within the ACHE approved for Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) data. Jacob is the HIPAA liason for NCSA
* [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/overview.html): HPC specific tool, you have to use a batch scheduler. Slurm is the scheduler that knows about the compute nodes in the cluster, allocates resources in the cluster so people aren't all picking "node1" and leaving "node24" under utilized and running a job. Slurm allows you to better utilize resources on the cluster. You tell it what memory/CPUs/GPUs/how long job will run and it will allocate those resources then launch the job at a later date. This means more efficient use of the computer
* [Munge github](https://dun.github.io/munge/) is a process that handles security for Slurm because Slurm runs acorss all the compute nodes. It needs to know who is authorized to run restrict Slurm to the cluster, compute nodes and the scheduler and the login/head nodes. They don't run via slurm, but end users connect there first then submit the job and munge will securely tell the scheduler what their unix user ID is so it can be added to permissions and make sure they have allocation/credits to run the job. Munge prevents users from running jobs as root or other cluster users. Without you can fake the UID and the scheduler would trust it and run jobs as a root user on the cluster which is not good!
* [Sun Grid Engine(SGE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Grid_Engine) was previously used at NCSA, now they upgraded to "Son of Grid Engine" that added Munge. Can keep running the same commands just with additional Munge support
* [Fakeroot](https://commandmasters.com/commands/fakeroot-linux/) does a preload trick and can fake out the UID that the program is presenting to other stuff and the programs run under the assumption that it's your UID, but through Munge you can securely check that the user is legit
* [High-throughput computing (HTC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-throughput_computing): uses a different scheduler called [HTCondor](https://htcondor.org/) that operates in HTC environments. The University of Wisconsin computer science program develops HT Condor. At UIUC, the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and small section of the campus computing cluster use HTCondor
* [nslookup](https://www.nslookup.io/): tool to find DNS records for a domain name
